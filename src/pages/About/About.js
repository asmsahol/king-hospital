            Madrasah is referred to institution specially designed for Islamic
            education and culture. Madrasah education commenced from the time of
            Hazrat Muhammad (Sm). He set up Darul Arqam at the foot of Makkah's
            Safa hill, Suffa Residential Madrasah and Darul Qurrah Madrasah on
            the north-eastern side of Masjid-e-Nababi after performing Hizrat
            (emigration to Medina). Besides, the Masjid-e-Nababi (622 AD) and 9
            other mosques of Medina were also used as education centres. Among
            the Caliphs, Hazrat Omar (R) and Hazrat Ali (R) set up two large
            madrasahs at Basra and Kufa. During the Umayyad rule, large mosques
            were used as Madrasahs. The Abbasid rulers used to patronise
            Madrasah education. Apart from constructing Mosque-based madrasahs,
            they also built separate madrasahs. Primary education at mosques for
            children was compulsory at that time.

            Madrasah education was introduced in Bengal during the Sultani era
            (1210-1576). Many madrasahs were set up in Bengal during that
            period. Among these, the Madrasah of Moulana Takiuddin Arabi at
            Mohisantosh is the oldest. In 1248, Sultan Nasiruddin, Badaruddin
            Ishaque, Minhazuddin, Nizamuddin Damiski and Shamsuddin Khawarizmi
            prepared a curriculum for madrasah education, which remained
            effective for one century.

            Moulana Abu Tawama set up a madrash at Sonargaon in 1278, and it was
            the biggest madrasah in the then Bengal. Sultan alauddin husain shah
            (1494-1519) established many madrasahs in Gaur and Maldaha. The
            madrasah curriculum during the Sultani era included Arabic, Nahu,
            Saraf, Balagat, Manatik, Kalam, Tasauf, literature, Fiqah and
            Philosophy.

            The scope of madrasah education was expanded during the Mughal era
            by including various branches of knowledge and science. At that
            time, Astronomy, Mathematics, Geography, Accounting, Agriculture,
            Public Administration, Biology, Zoology, Fine Arts etc were
            incorporated into madrasah education in phases.
